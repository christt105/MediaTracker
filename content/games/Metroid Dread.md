overview: 'Face off against unrelenting E.M.M.I. robots: once DNA-extracting research
  machines, the imposing E.M.M.I. are now hunting Samus down. Tensions are high as
  you evade these E.M.M.I. to avoid a cruel death while finding a way to take them
  down. Find out what turned these robotic wonders into the scourge of ZDR and escape
  with your life.  Feel Samus’ power grow as you gain maneuvers and abilities: acquire
  new and familiar abilities as you traverse the many environments of this dangerous
  world. Parkour over obstacles, slide through tight spaces, counter enemies, and
  battle your way through the planet. Return to areas and use your new abilities to
  find upgrades, alternate paths, and a way forward. Explore the sprawling map, evade
  and destroy E.M.M.I. robots, and overcome the dread plaguing ZDR.'
