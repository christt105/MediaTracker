overview: Both Team Magma and Team Aqua are featured as the villainous teams, each
  stirring trouble at different stages in the game. The objective of each team, to
  awaken Groudon and Kyogre, respectively, is eventually fulfilled. Rayquaza is prominent
  plot-wise, awakened in order to stop the destructive battle between Groudon and
  Kyogre. It is now the one out of the three ancient Pokémon that can be caught prior
  to the Elite Four challenge, while still at the same place and at the same high
  level as in Ruby and Sapphire.
