overview: In the city of Harran, a mysterious viral outbreak has turned most of the
  population into hyper-aggressive zombie-like creatures, forcing Harran's Defense
  Ministry to quarantine the entire city. The Global Relief Effort (GRE) assists survivors
  still trapped in the city by regularly airdropping supplies. The GRE hires Kyle
  Crane to infiltrate Harran in order to retrieve a sensitive file stolen from them
  by Kadir Suleiman, which he is using as leverage to blackmail them, with the threat
  of publicizing it if anything were to happen to him. Crane is airdropped into Harran,
  where he is ambushed by a gang of hostile bandits. As the infected attack, Crane
  is bitten and infected, but rescued by Jade Aldemir and Amir Ghoreyshi. Amir sacrifices
  himself to buy Jade and Crane time, and Jade takes him to a survivor sanctuary called
  the Tower. Crane wakes up and is introduced to Rahim Aldemir, Jade's brother. Rahim
  then teaches Crane parkour and sends him to Spike, who gives him his first task
  as a resident of the tower. Crane learns that the Tower, which seeks to help other
  survivors, is being harassed by a gang of bandits led by a warlord named Rais who
  steals and hoards the supplies from the GRE airdrops, including Antizin; a vaccine
  that suppresses symptoms of infection and keeps bitten people from turning into
  the infected. After Harris Brecken, leader of the tower is nearly killed by a rival
  runner in a mission to retrieve an Antizin drop, need for the drug becomes immense.
  Crane volunteers and manages to reach an airdrop containing Antizin, but despite
  the dire need of the vaccine by the survivors, Crane is instructed by the GRE to
  destroy the airdrop, instructing him to reach out to Rais in order to buy the vaccine
  in order to confirm his identity. Crane reluctantly complies and informs the Tower
  that the supplies have been looted.  Upset, Brecken tasks Crane with the job of
  making a deal with Rais. Upon meeting Rais, Crane is able to confirm that he is
  indeed Suleiman. He carries out a series of unethical tasks for Rais under the assumption
  that he will be rewarded with two crates of Antizin. Crane is unable to locate the
  file, and is later betrayed by Rais, who only gives him five vials of Antizin. He
  later breaks off business with the GRE when they halt the supply drops and refuse
  to help the Tower. The situation in the tower worsens, and a whole floor is sealed
  off when an outbreak occurs. While doing an errand, Rahim tells Crane that he and
  Omar were planning to bomb an infected nest. Crane is opposed to this plan. After
  an argument over the radio, he gives chase to a fleeing Rahim. Upon catching up
  to him, he finds that Omar is dead, while Rahim has been wounded. He then executes
  Rahim's plans, resulting in the killing of the infected in the compound. When he
  gets back to Rahim he discovers that he was actually bitten and had turned while
  Crane was gone, forcing Crane to respectfully snap Rahim's neck when he attacks
  him. When Crane returns to the tower to inform Brecken of the news, Jade overhears
  them, and visibly upset, takes off.  Meanwhile, a scientist at the Tower named Dr.
  Imran Zere, who was attempting to develop a cure for the virus, is kidnapped by
  Rais, prompting Crane to attempt a rescue mission. Crane is also captured by Rais,
  who reveals that the file he stole contains proof that the GRE intends to weaponize
  the virus rather than develop a cure and releases the file to the public. Crane
  manages to escape before being executed, resulting in Rais losing one of his hands
  during the process. Dr. Zere is killed in the rescue attempt, but manages to tell
  Crane that he had entrusted his research to Jade, who is tasked with delivering
  it to another scientist named Dr. Allen Camden. As Crane goes to look for Jade,
  he finds out that the Defense Ministry is planning to bomb Harran in an effort to
  completely eradicate the outbreak, claiming that there are no survivors left in
  the city. He manages to reactivate a radio tower and broadcasts a message to the
  outside world, thwarting the Ministry's plan. Jade was captured by Rais, who also
  steals Dr. Zere's research. Crane manages to rescue Jade and recover a part of Dr.
  Zere's research, but Jade admits that she has been bitten, and pleads with Crane
  to stop Rais. Jade then succumbs to the wound, forcing Crane to kill her. After
  killing Rais' assistant, Tair with his own machete, Crane delivers the tissue samples
  to Dr. Camden, who believes that he is very close to the cure, but needs the rest
  of Dr. Zere's data. Crane then finds out that Rais has cut a deal with the GRE,
  in which he will hand over Dr. Zere's research data to them in return for extraction
  from Harran. Crane then assaults Rais' headquarters (filled with infected) and battles
  him atop a skyscraper, eventually stabbing Rais in the neck and throwing him off
  the building. He recovers the research data and decides to turn it over to Dr. Camden
  instead of the GRE, intending to stay in Harran to help the survivors.
