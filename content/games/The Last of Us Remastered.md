overview: Twenty years after a mutated fungus started turning people all over the
  world into deadly zombies, humans become an endangered species. Joel, a Texan in
  his forties with the "emotional range of a teaspoon" (to quote Hermione from Harry
  Potter), finds himself responsible with the safety of a fourteen year old girl named
  Ellie whom he must smuggle to a militia group called the Fireflies. And as if the
  infected aren't enough of a hassle, they also have to deal with the authorities
  who wouldn't let them leave the quarantine zone, as well as other survivors capable
  of killing anyone who might have something useful in their backpacks.
