overview: Black Ops takes place between 1961 and 1968 during the Cold War, 16 years
  after the events of World at War. It portrays a secret history of CIA clandestine
  black operations carried out behind enemy lines. Much of the campaign is told through
  the eyes of SOG and CIA operative Alex Mason, primarily through flashbacks. Mason
  awakens strapped to a chair in a room filled with monitors, bombarded with questions
  by two unknown interrogators about a numbers broadcast. Mason then recalls several
  events from the past in an attempt to answer their questions, setting up the missions
  of the game.
