overview: Link is awakened in a room by a voice calling him and learns that he has
  been asleep for 100 years after failing to stop a monster called Calamity Ganon.
  Although the monster is being held in Hyrule Castle by Princess Zelda, Calamity
  Ganon's power continues to grow and if not stopped he will eventually break free
  with enough power to destroy the entire world. Link embarks on his quest to defeat
  Calamity Ganon and save Hyrule and Zelda.
