overview: Dishonored is set in Dunwall, an industrial whaling city where strange steampunk-inspired
  technology and otherworldly forces coexist in the shadows. You are the once-trusted
  bodyguard of the beloved Empress. Framed for her murder, you become an infamous
  assassin, known only by the disturbing mask that has become your calling card. In
  a time of uncertainty, when the city is besieged by plague and ruled by a corrupt
  government armed with industrial technologies, dark forces conspire to bestow upon
  you abilities beyond those of any common man, but at what cost? The truth behind
  your betrayal is as murky as the waters surrounding the city, and the life you once
  had is gone forever.
