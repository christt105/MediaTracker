overview: While patrolling the city one day, Spider-Man spots several thugs attempting
  to rob a bank and stops them. Later that night, after having dinner with his friends
  Mary Jane Watson (for whom he has hidden feelings) and Harry Osborn (who despises
  Spider-Man, blaming him for his father's death), Peter spots a van being chased
  by the police and follows it to the Queensboro Bridge, where the chase has led to
  a massive traffic accident. As Spider-Man, he rescues several endangered civilians
  and cops before following the van to a warehouse, where he finds thugs unloading
  explosives. While fighting the thugs, the explosives provoke a massive fire, but
  Spider-Man is able to put out the flames and deal with the remaining crooks.  Later,
  Harry introduces Peter to Dr. Otto Octavius, a nuclear scientist who is trying to
  make a fusion power experiment, sponsored by Oscorp, which would provide an unlimited
  power source to Manhattan. Octavius quickly befriends and begins to mentor Peter.
  While handling hazardous materials, Octavius wears a harness of powerful robotic
  tentacle arms with artificial intelligence. During a public demonstration Peter
  and Harry attend, a power spike causes the fusion reactor to destabilize. Octavius
  refuses to shut down the reactor, which goes critical—killing his wife and burning
  the inhibitor chip blocking the arms from his nervous system. Peter, as Spider-Man,
  shuts the experiment down, destroying it in the process. Later, the arms' AI begins
  to influence Octavius, and he becomes the villain Doctor Octopus, seeking to complete
  his work at all costs.
