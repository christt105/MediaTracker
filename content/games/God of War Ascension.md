overview: In a war between the astronomically large deities known as the Primordials,
  the madness and rage of the war took form, becoming the three guardians of honor,
  the Furies, who were tasked with exacting retribution onto any oath-breaker or betrayer.
  The first victim of the Furies was the Hecatonchires, Aegaeon, who had broken a
  blood oath to Zeus himself. The Furies set about their task, and, believing death
  to be too kind for one who had broken an oath to a God, transformed Aegaeon's humongous
  body into a stone prison for all who would dare follow his example in the future.
