overview: Deacon St. John, a former outlaw and drifter, searches for purpose in a
  world ravaged by a pandemic that has turned much of humanity into mindless, violent
  creatures called Freakers. Driven by the hope that his wife, Sarah, may still be
  alive, he navigates the dangers of the Pacific Northwest, facing hostile factions,
  freakish threats, and his own haunting memories. As he fights for survival, Deacon
  forms new alliances, confronts his past, and seeks answers about his wife’s fate,
  uncovering harsh truths about resilience and loss in a world on the edge.
