overview: Welcome to the Space Program! You're the newest recruit of Outer Wilds Ventures,
  a fledgling space program searching for answers in a strange, constantly evolving
  solar system. What lurks in the heart of the ominous Dark Bramble? Who built the
  alien ruins on the Moon? Can the endless time loop be stopped? Answers await you
  in the most dangerous reaches of space.  The planets of Outer Wilds are packed with
  hidden locations that change with the passage of time. Visit an underground city
  of before it's swallowed by sand, or explore the surface of a planet as it crumbles
  beneath your feet. Every secret is guarded by hazardous environments and natural
  catastrophes.  Strap on your hiking boots, check your oxygen levels, and get ready
  to venture into space. Use a variety of unique gadgets to probe your surroundings,
  track down mysterious signals, decipher ancient alien writing, and roast the perfect
  marshmallow.
