overview: The game follows Alexander J. Mercer (voiced by Barry Pepper) who wakes
  up in a morgue in the basement of Gentek, a genetic engineering company based in
  Manhattan, sending a pair of scientists that were just about to perform an autopsy
  running. Alex escapes, and witnesses the scientists being gunned down by military
  operatives. Alex is discovered and attacked. He survives bullets being fired into
  his chest, and leaps over a wall to safety. He soon discovers he now possesses powerful
  shapeshifting abilities, superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, senses,
  endurance, weaponry and the ability to 'consume' people to gain their memories,
  skills and appearance. With no memory of his previous life, Alex decides to find
  and consume those related to the conspiracy in order to uncover the truth.
