overview: Dr. Gordon Freeman arrives late for work at 8:47 am in the Black Mesa Research
  Facility, using the advanced Black Mesa tram system that leads through the facility.
  He arrives at the Anomalous Materials Lab, his work place, and he is informed by
  the security officer that the scientists have a special experiment today, so he
  goes to the locker room and puts on the hazard suit. He goes to the lab's lower
  levels, and arrives at the Anti-Mass Chamber, where he is instructed that the specimen
  to be used that day is the rarest and also the most unstable specimen. He is tasked
  with pushing the specimen into the scanning beam of the Anti-Mass Spectrometer for
  analysis. However as soon as he pushes it, it explodes, and creates a sudden catastrophe
  called a 'resonance cascade', opening a portal between Earth and a dimension called
  Xen. Freeman is apparently teleported to an alien planet and catches glimpses of
  various alien lifeforms, including a circle of Vortigaunts, shortly before blacking
  out.
