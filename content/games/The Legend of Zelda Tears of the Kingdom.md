overview: While exploring the caves underneath Hyrule Castle to investigate the origins
  of the gloom (a dangerous substance which appeared all over the kingdom), Link and
  Zelda not only find old archeological remains of the Zonai, an ancient race said
  to have descended from the sky, but also an maleficent mummy held by a bodiless
  arm, who suddenly reanimates, defeats Link, breaks the Master Sword and rise large
  structures, once found underground, to the skies above Hyrule, with Zelda vanishing
  with a spark from a strange amulet found on the site. Some time later, Link awakens
  in an unknown place on a floating sky island and meets a mysterious spirit called
  Rauru, which transplanted his arm (the same arm which was holding the mummy) onto
  Link, since his right arm was beyond saving. Guided by this new ally, Link sets
  out in an adventure to protect Hyrule, find Princess Zelda and uncover the mysteries
  of the Zonai.
